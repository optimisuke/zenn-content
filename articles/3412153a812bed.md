あんまり情報なかったのでメモ。

MakerSuite ってのを使ったらいいだけっぽいけど、そこに辿り着くまでのメモ。
[MakerSuite](https://makersuite.google.com/u/0/app/home?pli=1)

まず、ここにアクセス。API のドキュメント。
[Get an API key  |  PaLM API  |  Generative AI for Developers](https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup?authuser=1)

project 作るかとか聞かれるのでぽちぽちしていく。

`Create API key in new project`をクリック

こんな感じで試してみる。

```bash
PALM_KEY="YOUR KEY HERE"
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"prompt": {text: "Give me five subcategories of jazz"} }' \
     "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta3/models/text-bison-001:generateText?key=${PALM_KEY}"
```

こんな感じで返ってきた。
